# FCN
A simple implementation of _Fully Convolutional Network for Image Segmentation_ by Long et al.

## How to run
- To **train** the model, place [PASCAL VOC 2012](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/) and [SBD](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/semantic_contours/) under `datasets` and run `train.py`
- To **view sample outputs**, open and run `evaluation.ipynb`
