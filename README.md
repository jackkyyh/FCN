# FCN
A simple implementation of _Fully Convolutional Network for Image Segmentation_ by Long et al.

## How to run
- To **train** the model, place [PASCAL VOC 2012](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/) and [SBD](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/semantic_contours/) under `datasets` and run `train.py`
- To **view sample outputs**, open and run `evaluation.ipynb`
- Alternatively, trained model parameters can be downloaded from this [OneDrive link](https://connecthkuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/jackkyyh_connect_hku_hk/EaFTxSe45ZFOkjlL5WoZI94BZjyQiFResjfAsD_3Tmof3Q?e=Fq3aYg).
